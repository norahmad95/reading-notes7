## as me what I can do things that you will implement to improve your anxiety when giving a presentation?

* don't look at people eyes look at there head.but Make connections with your audience: Smile and greet people, thinking of them as friends rather than enemies.
* make a plane ta talk about your goal.
* whole you are speaking Use Metaphors, Similes, and Analogies.
*  keep in mind your audienceâ€™s capacity for remembering information.
* avoid a few nervous body language cues when speaking.
