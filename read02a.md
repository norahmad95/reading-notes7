***challenges***
its a great thing you must thing about it as a new knowledge and experience that will be added to you.the path to success isn’t linear and that whatever you’re looking for might be just around the next corner, so keep traying.

***effort***
actully growth mindset is not about what or how you do its about failure, its about how uou are go about doing it. 

***craticism***
do not base your worth on others opinion, the strong person dose not need approval of other.

***Success of others***
others success is somthing you should be inspired by, learne from, and add to it as they say energy transform fro one to another.


at the end what I says to my self is: **work while they are sleeping to get what they are dreaming**
