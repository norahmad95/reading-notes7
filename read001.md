# HTML5 layout:

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google. 

# PROCESS & Design:

* It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.7

# how browser see a web page ?
1- the browser recive an HTML page. 
2- it creats a model of the page. 
3- its show the page.

# how do I write ascript for a web page ?

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

* The HTML /<script>/ element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the /<link>/ element can be used to load a CSS file).

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
