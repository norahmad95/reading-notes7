# Debugging

* Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
* The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located
so you can try to find the exact error.
*JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
* If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
* Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
