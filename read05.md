**ther are different code for each situstion, in order to detarmine wich bath to take the script.**

## evaluating conditions & conditional statements:

 an expression evaluated, wich returns a valu in order to this is done by comparing to value using compresioin operator.wich return value of true and false, and its based on if,then and else.
 
 ##evaluating conditions:

| equle to '=='           |  compare tow value, to see if they are same.
|-------------------------|  
| is not equle to '!=='   |  compare tow value, to see if they are not same.
|-------------------------|
| strict equle to '==='   |  check the both data typing and value are the same.
|-------------------------|
| strict equle to '!==='  |  check the both data typing and value are not the same.

## structuring comparision operators :

***comparison operators usully return single value of true or false .***
*logical operators allow you to compare the result of more than one comparison opreator*

### while loope:
